# morph_project

This project is done as part of the Science Research Mentoring Program (SRMP) at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA), which provides an opportunity for high-school juniors and seniors to work on a year-long independent research project in astrophysics under the guidance of a CfA astrophysicist. Students learn what it is actually like to conduct real, cutting-edge research and work closely with living scientists from diverse backgrounds.

Specifically, this project is about how galaxies grow in size and mass with cosmic time. Today’s galaxies show a large diversity of shapes and sizes. However, we still do not understand how galaxies grow in size and mass with cosmic time. We will develop a simple numerical model to follow the growth of individual galaxies. We will then compare the predictions of our model to observations. This will help to determine what kind of physical mechanism lead to the observed sizes and shapes of today’s galaxies. Specifically, we will learn to use python in a scientific context and program our own simple galaxy growth model.
